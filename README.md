Hi Dev Decorators, 
to run this project, first run the php artisan serve command, then php artisan run dev. 
After that, you can also run php artisan run build. Once that is done, 
you can import the database by running php artisan migrate. Alternatively, 
I have already uploaded the database in this repository.
